### What to remember about `System.out.println`

* **`PrintStream` is a class**
* **`out` is NOT a class**
* `out` is a **variable (reference)** of type **`PrintStream`**
* `System.out` represents the **console (standard output)**
* `println()` is a **method** inside the `PrintStream` class
* Java already built all this so **printing is easy**
* **Don’t overthink internals now** — full breakdown comes later in OOP
